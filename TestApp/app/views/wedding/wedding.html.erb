<p>We are so thrilled that you will be joining us on 7 July 2016!<br>

There are two car parks: a small one next to the Old School Room and a large one behind the Old School Room.
Please ensure that cars do not obstruct access to the Rectory (behind St Nicholas’ Church) or to Densyl Cottage (behind the large car park). These are private homes and not part of the Church.

No photography is permitted during the ceremony.
